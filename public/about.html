  My journey in web development began with a curiosity for how things work online, which quickly evolved into a deep dive into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
  Over time, I expanded my toolkit to include frameworks like React and Node.js, as well as database management with tools like MongoDB and SQL. 
  I enjoy tackling complex challenges, whether it’s optimizing performance, ensuring responsive design, or integrating APIs seamlessly.

<p>
  Beyond coding, I value collaboration and communication, believing that the best projects come from understanding clients’ visions and translating them into reality. 
  When I’m not immersed in code, you can find me exploring new tech, sketching wireframes, or sipping coffee while brainstorming my next big idea. 
  I’m excited to bring my skills and creativity to every project I take on!
